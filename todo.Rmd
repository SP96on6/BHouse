### Hotel and Spa

* Shelley Point has an amazing hotel with a spa (book in advance!), as well as a lovely swimming pool area (you are welcome to use it, provided it is not too full - peak times they might ask if you are hotel residents).

* There is also a great pizza bar called Dorotheas (opens 11:00 - 18:00) which has amazing pizzas (really), cocktails, beer on tap and most weekends live music. 

* There's also a Cattle Baron restaurant at the top, with a lovely view and nice menu.

* We highly recommend going to Alegria restaurant (as you enter St. Helena Bay), Gaatjie & Leeto (Paternoster) as well.

* For the more active, there's a golf course, two tennis courts and lawn bowls (150m from the house) - for each you must please book at the golf club at the hotel.

* Shelley Point Kayaking is also a must - you often see dolfins, sunfish and if you are lucky a whale.
