### Our favourite sundowner spot is at [Marina se bankie](https://goo.gl/maps/cpqhR3hfDWWHBvKF9):

### Club House

* At the [Golden Mile security gate](https://goo.gl/maps/8kTsHdgG5Z81pvuw8) you'll find the SPHOA clubhouse.

There's a great deli as well as a playground for children. This is within the estate, so it is safe and secure - with great prices for food (we normally eat breakfast there as you can't make it for that cheap :) 

### Restaurants

* We highly recommend going to Alegria restaurant (as you enter St. Helena Bay), and also Gaatjie & Leeto (Paternoster).


### Experiences

* A MUST DO is the gin tasting at [Poetic License distillery](https://poeticlicensedistillery.co.za/) in Velddrift ([map link](https://goo.gl/maps/9izKoBDZiA9p5dEF7)). 25min drive, totally worth it.

### Pubs

* Above the swimming pool at the hotel (about 150m from the house) there's a nice cigar lounge with a pool table - nice for having a beer and overlooking the kids swimming below...

* For the thirsty, [Noordblinder](https://goo.gl/maps/nCvzuv2CW468daEs9) offers a nice easy going West-Coast pub vibe.

* If you have time, go to [Panty Bar](https://goo.gl/maps/cDQva4kc9SjL3pj67) in Paternoster - always a nice experience!

### Amenities

* You can enjoy a round of golf (first hole is ~200m from house), two tennis courts and lawn bowls (150m from the house) - for each you must please book at the golf club in the estate.

* Shelley Point Kayaking is also a must - you often see dolfins, sunfish and if you are lucky a whale (Whatsapp: 082 805 5363)

### Beaches

* Be sure to try out [Golden mile beach](https://goo.gl/maps/GsC7KPvfA5DCc3s88), [Light House beach](https://goo.gl/maps/vzUAc24WbHjdLi7X8) and the [launch beach (great if it is a windy day)](https://goo.gl/maps/Qt3m2vcvth4TatUw7)
