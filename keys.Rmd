* __Opening the front door:__
  
  ...Hold the unlock button on the remote a few seconds until alarm is deactivated.
  
  ....If alarm is on, you will see a red button above garage (little red light)

  ......Turn key in the **opposite direction** (clock-wise) and give it a good push

* __When you leave, please put the alarm on and drop the keys off at the security gate.__
